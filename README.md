This was my very first portfolio project, created when I initially started practicing front-end development. 
Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project represents the beginning of my journey into web development. 
Even though itâ€™s simple, it helped me understand the fundamentals of structure, styling, and interactivity in websites.
